# Meteofy
Meteofy is a Koltin application, based on OpenWeatherMap service for retrieving weather data. Users can input places and get the data formatted in a color coded way.

Building this project i have used:
- Model-View-Viewmodel (MVVM) for application structure
- Room for database management
- OkHttp3 for internet call
- Sheets by maxkeppeler for creating simple input method (https://github.com/maxkeppeler/sheets)
- Gson for Json parsing
